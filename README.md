# Pig Game

## How the game works
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until the player decides to hold or rolls a 1.
If the player decides to hold he/she will add the total sum of all the dice he/she has rolled during that turn to his/her total points.
If the dice shows a 1 the player will not receive any points and his/her turn will end letting the other player roll.
The one to get to 100 points or more first is the winner.
